List.keys Folder

This folder contains instances of AutoHotKey scripts used for recording the key and mouse inputs. Each instance records a specific hotkey input and saves the keystrokes in a text document. You can choose which hotkeys to record and ignore others as needed.

Contents:
- Record_Right_Click.ahk: Records the right-click hotkey input and saves it to "record_right_click.txt".
- Record_Left_Click.ahk: Records the left-click hotkey input and saves it to "record_left_click.txt".
- Record_Shift.ahk: Records the Shift key input and saves it to "record_shift.txt".
- Record_Space.ahk: Records the Space key input and saves it to "record_space.txt".
- Record_A.ahk: Records the 'A' key input and saves it to "record_a.txt".
- Record_W.ahk: Records the 'W' key input and saves it to "record_w.txt".
- Record_S.ahk: Records the 'S' key input and saves it to "record_s.txt".
- Record_D.ahk: Records the 'D' key input and saves it to "record_d.txt".

How to Use:
1. Double-click on the instance of the hotkey you want to record.
2. Perform the desired actions with the recorded hotkey.
3. The script will save the recorded keystrokes in the corresponding text document.

Notes:
