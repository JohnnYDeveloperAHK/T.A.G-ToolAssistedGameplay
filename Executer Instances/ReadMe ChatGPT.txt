Executed Instances Folder

This folder contains the instances of AutoHotKey scripts used for executing the recorded keystrokes. The recorded keystrokes are saved in text documents created by the calibration instances. These scripts will replay the keystrokes with the intended delays to reproduce the gameplay or actions.

Contents:
- Execute A.ahk: Executes the recorded 'A' key input.
- Execute D.ahk: Executes the recorded 'D' key input.
- Execute S.ahk: Executes the recorded 'S' key input.
- Execute W.ahk: Executes the recorded 'W' key input.
- Execute Shift.ahk: Executes the recorded 'Shift' key input.
- Execute Space.ahk: Executes the recorded 'Space' key input.
- Execute Left_Click.ahk: Executes the recorded left-click input.
- Execute Right_Click.ahk: Executes the recorded right-click input.

How to Use:
1. Manually add the recorded keystrokes from the calibration text documents to each script.
2. Double-click on each instance to run it.
3. The scripts will execute the recorded keystrokes with the intended delays.

Notes:
- Make sure the calibration data is consistent and precise for accurate execution.
- Save the calibration text documents in the main folder before using the executer instances.
