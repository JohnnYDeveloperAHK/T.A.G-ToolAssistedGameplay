Calibration Data Folder

This folder contains the instances of AutoHotKey scripts used for calibration. The purpose of calibration is to execute these instances, which record the key and mouse inputs, so that they run simultaneously in order to achieve precise timing for recording.

Contents:
- Run_Right_Click.ahk: Records the right-click hotkey input.
- Run_Left_Click.ahk: Records the left-click hotkey input.
- Run_Shift.ahk: Records the Shift key input.
- Run_Space.ahk: Records the Space key input.
- Run_A.ahk: Records the 'A' key input.
- Run_W.ahk: Records the 'W' key input.
- Run_S.ahk: Records the 'S' key input.
- Run_D.ahk: Records the 'D' key input.

How to Use:
1. Double-click on each instance to run it.
2. Once all instances are running, press F1 to activate calibration.
3. The instances will record the inputs with precise timing.

Notes:
- You can delete the text documents saved by each instance to ignore unwanted hotkeys.
- Calibration is essential for achieving accurate recording and playback.
