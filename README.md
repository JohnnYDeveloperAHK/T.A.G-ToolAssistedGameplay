 5. For a more convenient option, use the "Calibrator.Recorder.ahk" inside the "T.A.G" folder. This script runs all the instances required for recording the keystrokes in the "Calibration Data" folder. Simply execute the "Calibrator.Recorder.ahk", and it will handle running the calibration instances for you.

 6. Follow the instructions in each subfolder to calibrate, record, and execute the keystrokes according to your desired actions.
