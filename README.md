 A Tool Assisted Gameplay project using AutoHotKey for recording and executing keystrokes.

 Prerequisites
 Before using this project, make sure you have AutoHotKey V1 installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: https://www.autohotkey.com

 How to Use
 1. Download and install AutoHotKey V1 from the official website: https://www.autohotkey.com

 2. Clone or download this repository to your computer.

 3. Navigate to the "T.A.G-ToolAssistedGameplay" folder, which contains all the necessary files.

 4. Inside the folder, you will find three subfolders:
     - Calibration Data: Contains instances of AutoHotKey scripts used for calibration. Double-click on each instance to run it. Once all instances are running, press F1 to activate calibration. The instances will record the inputs with precise timing.
     - Executed Instances: Contains instances of AutoHotKey scripts used for executing the recorded keystrokes. Manually add the recorded keystrokes from the calibration text documents to each script. Double-click on each instance to run it. The scripts will execute the recorded keystrokes.
     - List.keys: Contains instances of AutoHotKey scripts used for recording the keystrokes. Double-click on each instance to run it. The scripts will record the key and mouse inputs.

 5. For a more convenient option, use the "Calibrator.Recorder.ahk" inside the "T.A.G" folder. This script runs all the instances required for recording the keystrokes in the "Calibration Data" folder. Simply execute the "Calibrator.Recorder.ahk", and it will handle running the calibration instances for you.

 6. Follow the instructions in each subfolder to calibrate, record, and execute the keystrokes according to your desired actions.
